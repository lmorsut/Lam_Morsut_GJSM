The codes for the paper: Parameterized Computational Framework for the Description and Design of Genetic Circuits of Morphogenesis Based on Contact-Dependent Signaling and Changes in Cellâ€“Cell Adhesion 
can be found in the ACS Paper branch.


These files are the codes for the following bioRxiv manuscript: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/784496v2

These files run in CompuCell3D v3.7.8. I intend to update them to the current version of CC3D soon.
As they are, these files are complete and ready to run in CC3D. HOWEVER, I recommend changing the "USEDNODES" parameter to suit your system.
Calling 8 cores on a quad/dual core cpu will be painful. Please also see the CC3D authors' recommendations in their documentation.

Some figure labels do not have a corresponding code file. This is because the code used to generate said figure is from one of the other folders. 
These files are: SFig.1b Code derives From Fig.3b.2 Code, SFig.4 Code derives From Fig.4a.1 Code, SFig.5 Code derives From Fig.4a.2 Code, SFig.6b Code derives From Fig.4a.3 Code,
SFig.7 Code derives From Fig.4a.4 Code, SFig.8.c Code derives From Fig.4b Code, SFig.9 Code derives From Fig.5e Code, SFig.10a Code derives From Fig.6c Code, SFig.10b Code derives From Fig.6d Code,
SFig.10c Code derives From Fig.6e Code.

The oscillation files have their cells color swapped for circuit schematic consistency. See the individual ReadMes in those files.

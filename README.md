These files are the codes for the following bioRxiv manuscript: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/784496v1.abstract

These files run in CompuCell3D v3.7.8. I intend to update them to the current version of CC3D soon.
As they are, these files are complete and ready to run in CC3D. HOWEVER, I recommend changing the "USEDNODES" parameter to suit your system.
After all, calling 8 cores on a quad/dual core cpu would be painful. As a general rule, the parameter should be a power of 2 for clean division of the lattice.

The file names do not align to the bioArxiv preprint and align to the current version of the manuscript to be submitted. This will be rectified in the final version of the manuscript.

Some figure labels do not have a corresponding code file. This is because the code used to generate said figure is from one of the other folders. 
These files are: SFig.1b Code derives From Fig.3b.2 Code, SFig.4 Code derives From Fig.4a.1 Code, SFig.5 Code derives From Fig.4a.2 Code, SFig.6b Code derives From Fig.4a.3 Code,
SFig.7 Code derives From Fig.4a.4 Code, SFig.8.c Code derives From Fig.4b Code, SFig.9 Code derives From Fig.5e Code, SFig.10a Code derives From Fig.6c Code, SFig.10b Code derives From Fig.6d Code,
SFig.10c Code derives From Fig.6e Code.

The oscillation files have their cells color swapped for circuit schematic consistency. See the individual ReadMes in those files.
